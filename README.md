# RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE
Responsive *landing page* created using HTML5, JavaScript & CSS3. 
The Landing page is a redesign of my friend's online music store(https://musiqhunt.com/).


## What I have learned
- Mobile first approach
- Responsive Web Design
- JS Animation, *having hero image move with the mouse*
